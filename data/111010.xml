Thus the two halves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict.<br/>The attribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal is danger, guile. Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict.<br/>A third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the combination of deep cunning within and fixed determination outwardly.

			<judgement><![CDATA[CONFLICT. You are sincere<br/>And are being obstructed.<br/>A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.<br/>Going through to the end brings misfortune.<br/>It furthers one to see the great man.<br/>It does not further one to cross the great water.]]></judgement>
			<judgement_explaination><![CDATA[Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs into opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict.<br/>If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear-headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity is then perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to conquer danger without.]]></judgement_explaination>

				<second_explaination><![CDATA[In a struggle with an enemy of superior strength, retreat is no disgrace. Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences.

				<third><![CDATA[To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.<br/>Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.<br/>If by chance you are in the service of a king,<br/>Seek not works.]]></third>
				<third_explaination><![CDATA[This is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition. Only that which has been honestly acquired through merit remains a permanent possession. It can happen that such a possession may be contested, but since it is really one's own, one cannot be robbed of it. Whatever a man possesses through the strength of his own nature cannot be lost. If one enters the service of a superior, one can avoid conflict only by not seeking works for the sake of prestige. It is enough if the work is done: let the honor go to the other.]]></third_explaination>
